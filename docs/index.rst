CONQUEST: a local orbital, large-scale DFT code
===============================================

CONQUEST is a local orbital density functional theory (DFT) code,
capable of massively parallel operation with excellent scaling.  It
uses a local orbital basis
to represent the Kohn-Sham eigenstates or the density matrix.
CONQUEST can be applied to atoms, molecules, liquids and solids, but
is particularly efficient for large systems.  The code can find the ground
state using exact diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian or via a linear
scaling approach.  The code has demonstrated scaling to over 2,000,000
atoms and 200,000 cores when using linear scaling, and over 3,400
atoms and 850 cores with exact diagonalisation.
CONQUEST can perform structural relaxation (including unit cell
optimisation) and molecular dynamics (in NVE, NVT and NPT ensembles
with a variety of thermostats).
